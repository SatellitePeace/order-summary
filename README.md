# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card

The challenge was to build an already designed order summary card component from scratch and get it to look as close to the original design as possible

## Tools I Used

I used

1.  Semantic HTML5
2.  CSS grid, flexbox and other css properties to structure and style this order summary card.

## What I Learned

I learnt how to use SVG design patterns t create my background

I also learnt a new way of using the SPAN element in both HTML5 and CSS3
